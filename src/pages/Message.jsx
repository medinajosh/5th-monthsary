            Happy 5th Monthsary, my love. ðŸ’•

            It's amazing how deeply connected we are even with all this distance between us. Every morning I wake up thinking of you, and every night, I fall asleep with you in my heart. You've become my home, even from miles away.

            Baby, thank you for being so patient and so understanding. You've brought a light into my life that I didnâ€™t even know I was missing. Iâ€™ll forever be grateful for your love, your laugh, your voice on the phone when I need it most, and every little thing that makes me happy.

            I wish I could hold your hand right now, look into your eyes, and tell you how much I love you. But until that day comes until I can finally be by your side please carry this message in your heart. This little page, this album, this giftâ€¦ it's my way of sending my love to you in every possible way.

            I love you more than words can say. Here's to all our monthsaries, anniversaries, and forever. ðŸ’–

            With all of me,  
            Your baby *Juswaaaaa* ðŸ«¶
